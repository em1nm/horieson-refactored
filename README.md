ReadMe.md Homework 1: Refactoring Existing Code

## Description 
In this exercise, we begin by receiving code to a ready website. 
A marketing agency would like us to modify their current website to meet accessibility standards optimal for search engines. In this task, we will view the source code and find semantic HTML elements and find a better structure of styling and positioning to meet the agency's needs. 
Refactoring existing code consists of taking someone's code and improving 
it without changing it's functionality. We will create a new header with functional tabs, change elements to follow a more fluid structure by changing styling and positioning and find accessible alternative attributes.

## Installation
    Using VS Code, we have created an updated web browswer for Horiseon consisting of a new header that shows three links to their main focus: Search Engine Optimization, Online Reputation Management and Social Media Marketing. By clicking each tab, you will automatically be directed to the description of said tab.
